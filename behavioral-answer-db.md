I was building a backend API using Express and PostgreSQL with a layered architecture. During integration, the database connection failed with a SASL authentication error. After reviewing logs, I traced the issue to missing environment variables and an undefined password in the connection config. To resolve it, I introduced a structured .env file for the user, password, database, host, and port, then validated the credentials directly using psql. Once the configuration was corrected and migrations ran properly, the API was able to create and query user records without issues.

This experience strengthened my debugging workflow and highlighted the importance of environment configuration and secrets management in backend development. It also reinforced why validating assumptions at the infrastructure level is critical before debugging application logic.
