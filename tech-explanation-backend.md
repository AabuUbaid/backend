The backend follows a layered architecture that cleanly separates HTTP handling, business logic, and data persistence. Routes define the public HTTP API surface, controllers handle request orchestration, services enforce business rules, and repositories interact with PostgreSQL through parameterized SQL queries. Data flows Router → Controller → Service → Repository → Database, and responses return in reverse order as JSON. This architectural separation prevents coupling SQL with HTTP logic, improves maintainability and testability, and supports scalability as features like authentication, validation, and pagination are introduced.
